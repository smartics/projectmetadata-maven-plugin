Projectmetadata Maven Plugin
============================

Collects and bundles metadata about the project and attaches the artifact containing this metadata to the build.

##Overview

This plugin for [Maven] (http://maven.apache.org/) creates an archive containing project metadata. The attached metadata can later be accessed and processed to generate documentation that is based on information extracted from the project.

A set of report files are attached by default. Additional custom files can be attached easily.
